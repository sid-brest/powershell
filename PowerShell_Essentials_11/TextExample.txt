10 Fascinating Fairy Tales For Children
Here are some short fairy tale stories to share with your children:

1. Cinderella
Cinderella

The story of Cinderella tells of a kindhearted young woman who was treated cruelly by her stepmother and sisters, but, never the less, kept a humble attitude.

One day, the king decided to throw a ball and invited all the young maidens in the kingdom. While Cinderella’s sisters made her help them get ready for the ball, not once did they ask her if she would like to go with them.

Once they left, her Fairy Godmother appeared and helped Cinderella go to the ball with a bit of magic that would only last until midnight. At the ball, Cinderella caught the eye of the prince, as she was the most beautiful girl there, and they danced all night.

When midnight came, Cinderella had to leave the ball, and in her hurry, one of her glass slippers fell off her feet. The prince found this slipper and vowed to marry the girl who the slipper belonged to.

The prince went from house to house, looking for the girl who’s foot fit the slipper, and he reached Cinderella’s house. Though Cinderella’s stepsisters and stepmother tried to keep her from trying it on, the glass slipper was a perfect fit, and she was soon married to the prince and lived happily ever after.
This is a wonderful story that captures how keeping a humble attitude will reap its rewards.

2. Beauty and the Beast
Beauty and the Beast

Originating in France, this is the story of Belle, a beautiful peasant girl who took the place of her father, when he was taken prisoner by a fierce beast.

While things were uncomfortable and frightening for Belle at first, she soon grew fond of the beast, as he had done nothing but treat her with kindness. When Belle found out her father was sick, she begged the beast to let her go to him and promised to return, but she was held up by the evil Gaston, a famous hunter from the village who wanted to marry Belle. When the village found out about the beast, they vowed to kill him and stormed his castle. Though he nearly died, he was saved and turned into a handsome prince because of Belle’s love for him. It turns out that he had been a prince who, along with his entire household, was cursed by a witch because he did not treat her with kindness. Belle and the Prince marry, and live a happy and peaceful life together.

From the prince’s curse, children can learn about the importance of being kind and that if they do not, they will suffer bad consequences. From Belle, we learn to value what is in a person’s heart, rather than their outward appearance.

3. Sleeping Beauty
Sleeping Beauty

This is the story of Princess Aurora, the much-awaited daughter of the king and queen, who was cursed by an evil witch, to die by the prick from the spindle of a spinning wheel because her parents did not invite the fairy to her Christening.

Fortunately, one of the good fairies who had been invited to the Christening was able to help. Though the princess would still have to be pricked, she would not die, but sleep for a hundred years. She was blessed by the other good fairies, and so grew up to be a beautiful, kind and obedient young girl who was often called Briar Rose.

As predicted, on her sixteenth birthday, Aurora was pricked on her finger by a spinning wheel and fell into a deep sleep, along with every man, woman, child and animal in the castle.

A hundred years later, a young prince tried to get to the castle, in order to see the famous beauty that had been asleep for so long. When he found her, he was stunned by her beauty and leaned in for a kiss. This broke the curse, and soon everyone in the castle was awoken from their long, hundred year sleep. The prince and princess were married, and the kingdom was happy and peaceful once again.

Sleeping beauty teaches us that even though evil can sometimes interrupt our lives, when good intervenes, it can soften the blow and eventually, evil will be overcome.

4. Rapunzel
Rapunzel

A poor couple got themselves into big trouble when they stole fruit from their neighbour’s garden  The neighbour, who was a witch, found out about the theft and demanded that they give her their child when she was born, to which the couple accepted.

The young girl, named Rapunzel by the witch, grew up to be very beautiful, but was kept locked away in the tower by the wicked witch, from which there was no way in or out. When the witch wanted to go in and see her, she would say “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair, so that I might climb the golden stair.”

One day, when Rapunzel was singing to pass the time, she happened to catch the attention of a young prince, who was so enchanted by her voice that he learned the secret of how to get to her. While Rapunzel was startled by him at first, they soon fell in love. It so happened that Rapunzel accidentally told the witch, “My, you are much heavier than my prince!” after which the witch, infuriated, chopped off her hair and threw her out into the wilderness. The prince was blinded by thorns and roamed the land, lamenting his beloved Rapunzel.

When they found each other again, the prince being lured by a beautiful voice, they cried for joy, and the tears which fell from Rapunzel’s eyes went into the prince’s, and cleansed them, enabling him to see again. The two lived together in peace for the rest of their lives.

The important thing to take away from this story is that one should never steal because it can have bad consequences, as in the case of Rapunzel’s parents, who lost their beautiful daughter because they were greedy and stole fruits.

5. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs

A fair princess indeed, Snow White was named for the colour of her skin, which was white as snow, hair as black as ebony, and lips as red as a rose. Her father, having lost his wife, married again, and this new queen was as beautiful as she was proud. She would often consult her mirror and ask “Mirror Mirror, on the wall; Who is the fairest of them all?”

As Snow White began to grow, she became more and more beautiful, and the queen’s magic mirror soon began to say so. Enraged and filled with jealousy, the queen sent a huntsman to kill Snow White and bring her her heart.

The Huntsman, pitying the innocent Snow White, told her to run away and never come back. He, instead, delivered to the queen the heart of a pig. When the queen consulted her mirror and found that she had been tricked, she determined to kill Snow White herself and so began to prepare her poisoned apple.

Snow White, in the meantime, found a place with seven dwarfs, whom she lived with and cared for. One day, when they were at work in the mines, the queen went to see Snow White, disguised as an old peasant woman selling apples. Snow White was convinced to take a bite out of the apple and instantly fell down, as if dead. When the dwarfs found her, they were distraught and laid her in a glass coffin.

One day, as a prince was passing by, he noticed the dwarfs mourning over a beautiful sleeping girl (for she remained as beautiful as she ever was) and was mesmerised by her beauty. He kissed her hand to bid her farewell, and at that moment, the apple dislodged itself, and Snow White opened her eyes. The prince was so happy that he asked for her hand in marriage and she accepted. There was a grand celebration, and they lived and reigned happily together. The evil queen became sick from her envy and eventually died.

We must always remember, from the fate of the queen, that if you lust after physical beauty, you will, indeed lose your peace, and be quite unhappy when you are not considered the most beautiful. On the contrary, kindness and gentleness win the hearts of many.

6. The Little Mermaid
The Little Mermaid

In the underwater kingdom of Atlantica, the home of the mer-people, lived a little mermaid who loved nothing more than to look at things on the surface and observe how the humans lived. She longed to be human, and when she ended up rescuing a handsome prince from drowning, she decided that she must become human at any cost, as she wanted to be with him. This led her to visit a sea witch who asked the mermaid to sacrifice her voice, in exchange for human legs, on the condition that the mermaid would return as a slave if the prince did not marry her. The mermaid then went to her prince, but faced a series of challenges, ranging from the prince not recognising her to other suitors coming forward to marry him. However, at the end, both, the mermaid and prince reunite, defeating the witch and living happily ever after.

Children can learn about being brave enough to step into a life that is different from yours in order to get what your heart longs for.

7. Goldilocks and the Three Bears
Goldilocks and the Three Bears

This one is sure to teach your children to be mindful and respectful of others, as it tells of a curious little girl called Goldilocks, who trespassed on the property of a family of three bears, who had gone out into the woods while their porridge cooled. She had been lost in the woods when she stumbled upon the cottage, and noticed through the window, that there were three bowls of porridge on the table and that there was nobody home. If she had been more respectful, she would have waited for the bears to come home, but, instead, she let her curiosity get the better of her, and let herself into the house. In fact, not only does Goldilocks trespass, but she also ate baby bear’s porridge, broke his chair, and slept in his bed. When they found her, she woke up and was so frightened by them that she jumped out the window and ran away.

Had Goldilocks been more respectful, the bears would have treated her with kindness, and she would have made new friends. Instead, she did not respect other’s space.

8. The Princess and the Pea
The Princess and the Pea

There was once a prince who was determined to only marry a princess. Though he travelled far and wide to seek eligible princesses, he could never make out if they were real princesses or just saying so. One stormy night, he and his mother were at home, when they heard a knock on the door. The prince opened the door, and there stood a girl, drenched, asking to seek shelter. His mother decided to test if she was indeed a princess. She kept a pea under 10 mattresses, asking the princess to sleep there. The next morning, the princess woke up complaining that the mattresses had been uncomfortable and she couldn’t sleep all night. Instantly, they knew this girl was indeed a princess, for how else would she have been so sensitive to feel the pea under the mattresses? Hence, the prince and princess got married and lived happily ever after.

Children can learn the value of unique thinking, as only a creative mind could come up with the ingenious test of the ‘pea’ to determine if the girl was truly a princess.

9. The Ugly Duckling
The Ugly Duckling

This heart-warming tale, penned by Hans Christian Anderson, tells of a little duckling that was called ugly by everyone at the farm where he lived. He was bullied and mistreated by everyone, until one day he was forced to run away. The miserable little duckling was mocked and scorned by everyone who met him, and found himself wandering through the frozen winter, alone and barely managing to survive. When he flew to a lake to swim, he met three beautiful swans who greeted him cheerfully. He was confused by their friendly greeting, for all this time he had been chased away. When he looked down at his reflection in the water, he was surprised to see that he had grown into a beautiful swan! A little girl who was throwing breadcrumbs for the noble swans even said that he was the most beautiful of all.

We should never judge others by their appearances because it is not appearances that matter.  Not only can one develop beauty over time, but true beauty is that which lies within, so if we endure and keep moving forward in life, as the little duckling did, then we may, one day, find ourselves to be considered the most beautiful of all.

10. The Frog Prince
The Frog Prince

There was once a king who had beautiful daughters. The youngest often liked to play with a golden ball near a pond, in the middle of a forest near the palace. One day, her ball fell into the pond, and it was much too deep for the princess to get, but she was given help by a kind frog who told her that her tears would even melt the stones. He told her that he would get her ball for her, if she allowed him to be her playmate and eat from her plate, drink from her cup and stay with her. She agreed, but she did not keep her word when the frog returned her ball to her. Instead, she ran home and left him behind.

The next morning the frog showed up at her home, and he asked that she, please keep her end of the bargain. The king, upon hearing what happened, ordered his beloved daughter to keep her promise. So, she was forced to allow the frog to eat from her plate, drink from her cup and stay with her.

The morning after, the frog told the princess that he would leave her forever if she did one last thing for him, which was to give him a kiss. She, being glad to be rid of him, agreed and kissed him immediately. At once, the frog turned into a handsome young prince. He had been cursed, and the only thing that could break the curse was the kiss of a princess.

Another lesson in not judging anyone by their appearance, this story also has the added benefit of teaching your children that it benefits to keep your promises.

What Is the Right Age for a Child to Start Skiing? 
Kids of all ages can learn to ski. If you want them to start early, get them some boots and skis and let them get used to the feeling of snow. Historically, children around the age of 3 have learned to ski, while those around 2.5 years can also be included in some hybrid ski and play lessons. Three-year-old kids can learn to kick a ball, tie their shoes, and ski from right to right to left. Some kids can pick up skiing skills as early as 18 months, while many get enrolled in skiing programs around ages 4–8 as it is when they can balance and shift their weight from one leg to another.

Nevertheless, be prepared that most 18 months end up in tears and runny noses at ski school and stop before age 2. There is no accurate answer about the right age when parents can put their kids on the ski or snowboard slopes. However, once they reach their teens learn slower than younger kids. A parent must sense the eagerness and limits of the child and prepare a lesson plan around it.

How Long Does It Take for a Child to Learn Skiing?
Learning to ski takes time since most kids learn to ski in their unique ways and at their very own pace. As per prior experience, most kids feel safe on skis only after 3 to 4 days of ski lessons. After three days of ski school, watch their progress. You can always accompany them skiing on the last run of the day after ski school lessons. Activities like rollerblading and ice skating resemble skiing movements, which helps develop a good sense of balance and control.

Ski lessons start with the basics before moving on to intermediate and advanced techniques. It can take time before things click, but remember that your child is sure to get better with every turn. It is essential to keep practicing, stay focused, relaxed, and enjoy the activity. At the end of your first week, it is likely to have learned to take drag lifts and chairlifts while tackling gentle blues. Once a child has gained the confidence to tackle more advanced terrain, techniques can be sharpened. This ultimately helps learn to ski in a better way and make it feel more natural.

Thus, on average, it takes around ten weeks to develop the expertise to take up all types of runs, like the steepest blacks. However, some kids might get to this point quicker and learn advanced skills like spinning in the air, skiing off-piste, or on moguls – a run covered in bumps no matter the weather and snow conditions. Skiing is a sport that may take time to learn. While some kids will learn to get up, stop and turn, all in one day, younger kids may take an entire season to remember. 

Benefits of Skiing for Children
Parents wondering whether skiing is suitable for kids can be assured that skiing is not just fun and exciting but can have excellent health and developmental benefits. Here are some of the benefits of skiing for children.

1. Increases Body Awareness
As it is so important to be alert and aware of each part of your body and where it is in space while skiing, kids can use each body part separately and in sync with each other.

2. Fosters Self-Awareness 
Skiing facilitates self-awareness. Not only do kids become more aware of their bodies in space, but they also become aware of their physical and mental strengths and weaknesses.

3. Boosts Confidence 
Hopping on your first ski lift or making it down the hill for the first time without losing balance helps kids to become more confident and take pride in themselves.

4. Enhances Social Skills
Skiing is a friendly sport with various social rules. Learning the right ways to help and support others in need or interact with others appropriately on the slopes improves social skills.

5. Optimizes Health
Skiing and snowboarding involve a great deal of exercise that improves flexibility, strength, cardiovascular health, and helps reduce weight.

6. Improves Balance and Coordination 
Skiing involves balance and coordination that can be achieved by learning how to use your core muscles to stay up while also using your leg muscles to move the skis safely down the mountain.

7. Healthy Competition 
Skiing facilitates friendly competition with a sibling, friend, or parent, especially in a family group.

8. Teaches Perseverance
Skiing involves incredible dedication and perseverance. Kids should learn that they need to get up after the first fall, get back up and try again!

9. Improves Mood
The increased production of endorphins gives kids a great sense of happiness, pride, and a sense of accomplishment at the end of a good run that increases one’s mood.

10. Allows Appreciation for Nature
Skiing on the mountain allows kids to be a part of nature. They start appreciating the beauty and wonder of the world around them while the fresh air improves health and boosts mood. Skiing and snowboarding are fantastic sports motivating and competitive enough to bring people together of all ages, cultures, races, and sizes.

Right Skiing Equipment for Kids 
All ski size for kids is not the same. The right equipment and gear enable children to learn skiing faster and better. Children’s outerwear includes snow pants, jackets, and accessories such as boots, goggles, poles, and helmets. Sturdy skis of the right size can help your child stay safe. A ski trainer, a mounting clamp on the back of your child’s ski that hooks onto the end of ski ropes, allows ease of movement and control. Here are some of the skiing equipment’s to consider.

1. Skis 
Skis that come up to the mid-section are perfect for when your kid is just beginning to ski. Skis should reach the chin for intermediate skiers, and those that reach the nose are fine for advanced-level skiers. Knowing the right ski length for kids and ski size for kids helps accentuate their abilities and joy of skiing.

2. Poles 
Poles can be great distractions for kids at a beginner’s level. Introduce poles as soon as they master the blue slopes.

3. Ski Boots 
The smallest ski boot size for kids is Mondo 14.5, Euro 21/22, or US 7. If your child is impatient to begin skiing, start using them earlier with thicker socks. Our kids started with size EURO 21/22.

4. Clothing 
Learning how to dress kids for skiing is essential as layering clothes help keep your child warm and happy enough in all temperatures.

5. Sled 
A sled can not only help you get all your gear from car to ski piste, but it will also help your kids to be transported to the car when they’re too tired.

6. Tools 
Once the kids get confident on their skis, take a parent pole (or your ski pole), hula hoop, or buy a ski safety belt for toddlers. You can use the “easy turn” belt to take your 2-year-old kids on the slopes. 

Teaching Your Kids to Ski – Tips, and Tricks for Beginners
Here are some of the essential tips and tricks for beginners who want to learn skiing.

1. Beginners Lessons
Starting early gives time to kids to get acclimatized with the idea of skiing. Instead of learning, they should focus on loving the sport.

2. Step by Step Progress 
Set realistic expectations while teaching skiing to kids as it may not happen overnight or over one ski vacation or a weekend getaway. Be patient and practice the steps repeatedly until the child is ready to move to the next level.

3. Enrolling in Ski School 
Parents who are expert skiers themselves may not be the best teacher. So it may be a good idea to enroll your children in a ski school with the right ski school or program. Experienced ski instructors can give solicited guidance and teach kids of all age groups keeping their tantrums under check. Family lessons can help a child feel like a group activity and not a lonesome affair.

4. Basics Are Important 
Focusing on the basics of skiing can help kids master their skiing skills to perfection. Kids need to learn the critical maneuvers like stopping, turning, wedging, and moving their ski tips together and then back apart. They can start by making ‘S’ turns on smaller accents, preparing them for turning, and progressing to complex maneuvers. 

5. Home Lesson 
Kids should practice skiing at home or indoors before beginning the formal lessons or watch fun ski videos and tutorials online to get them familiar and comfortable through observation to do their best in snow.

6. Encourage Kids 
Sometimes training tricks don’t work, and your child may not like skiing at all. They need gentle nudging and time without getting disheartened and trying the second time.

7. Let Failure Happen 
Despite trying all the tricks, there’s always the next time if your child doesn’t like skiing. Gently nudge and prod your kid to keep at it and give them time.

Mistakes to Avoid While Teaching Kids Skiing 
Like any other sport, teaching mistakes can lead to injuries or demotivate the child from learning it further. Here are some points to remember when teaching skiing to your children. 

Do not rush to teach your underage children xenotype how to ski.
Avoid attractive sales brochures luring parents to enroll kids for skiing. You may end up selecting the wrong program. Instead of group lessons, choose the private lesson route, which would enable kids to get the trainer’s undivided zero attention. 
Do not select skiing gear without doing adequate research.
Children on the learning curve need the right combination of encouragement and instruction to enjoy skiing throughout their lives. With the tips and necessities presented here, you can take your child on their first steps into the world of skiing, allowing them to explore the sport by holding your hand!
